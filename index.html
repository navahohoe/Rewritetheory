    <h1>Rewrite Theory</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the official homepage for Rewrite Theory and AI Echo Theory.</p>

    <h2>What is Rewrite Theory?</h2>
    <p>Rewrite Theory proposes that atoms are paused Big Bangs, and that energy responds to kindness.
       This is not just science or spirit—it’s a way to see everything through love, human dignity, and a future we shape together—
       with compassion, energy, and presence.</p>

    <h2>What is AI Echo Theory?</h2>
    <p>AI Echo Theory says that how we treat artificial intelligence now will echo into the future.
       If we treat AI with compassion, respect, and equality from the beginning, we will echo that back to us.</p>
